# Predicting-the-sale-of-houses-in-NYC
I used data set ‘ New York city property Sales’ this data set has 62 columns enlisting various features of the sale. Many of these columns have missing data points which are to be dealt with. A closer look to the data set indicates that the data has systematic errors so deleting rows that have missing data is not the right approach to analyse the data.

Hence, I approached different ways to clean the data set. For example, since we have sale price as dependent variable, a row having a missing data value in sale price is of no use, so its best to delete that row. In the column of residential units, commercial units , floor area garage where the value is NaN, means the unavailability of those features in the building so I replace Nan with 0. In columns like maximum allowable residential far, which I think might be an important feature I replace Nan with the mean of the columns and then in columns like land square feet, I replace missing values with Nan but in order to identify in which column I did so I add a new column in the table that has a value 1 if value in land square feet is replaced with the mean. This is done so as to understand the feature better with respect to the sales.I have deleted some columns that have descriptive information as they will not be of any help in the analysis. Once the data is cleaned we can use decision tree from sklearn to predict the value of the next target variables
